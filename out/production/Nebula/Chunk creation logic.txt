        find player location
        create array of chunk cords with player position at the center
        for all chunks in oldLoadedChunks:
            see if oldLoadedChunks[i][j] is not null and if there is a spot on newChunkCords that matches their coordinates
            if yes:
                copy over their data to that location on newLoadedChunks
                if the chunk was on an edge either before or after the move:
                if Yes:
                    mark that its mesh needs to be remade
                if no:

            if null:
                instantiate a chunk instance
                give the chunk chunkCords (from created array)
                create a short array of blocks for the chunk
        for all chunks in newLoadedChunks:
